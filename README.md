# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree-Projects
##### Sarah Alabdulhadi,

This repository contains the different projects I did for completion of the Data Analyst Nano-Degree (DAND) offered by Udacity.

### Part 1: Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Project
Complete your first project analyzing bike rental data. It’s a great project to tackle during the first week in your Nanodegree to see if the program is a good fit for you!
- **[Project: Analyze Bay Area Bike Share Data](https://github.com/AlabdulhadiSara/Data-Analysis-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%201)**
    
   
   
### Part 2: Descriptive Statistics
Learn to use descriptive statistics to describe properties of datasets and learn about how samples and populations are related.
- **[Project: Descriptive Statistics](https://github.com/AlabdulhadiSara/Data-Analysis-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%202)**



### Part 3: Intro to Data Analysis
Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings.
- **[Project: Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/AlabdulhadiSara/Data-Analysis-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%203)**



### Part 4: Data Wrangling
Choose a region of the world from [www.openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) and then use data wrangling techniques to audit and clean the data. You'll then use a database to query the cleaned data.
- **[Project: Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data](https://github.com/AlabdulhadiSara/Data-Analysis-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%204)**
  
  
  
### Part 5: Exploratory Data Analysis
Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and relationships.
- **[Project: Explore and Summarize Data](https://github.com/AlabdulhadiSara/Data-Analysis-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%205)**
    
    
    
### Part 6: Inferential Statistics
Use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology.
- **[Project: Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](https://github.com/AlabdulhadiSara/Data-Analysis-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%206)**



### Part 7: Intro to Machine Learning
Play detective and put your machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.
- **[Project: Identify Fraud from Enron Email](https://github.com/AlabdulhadiSara/Data-Analysis-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%207)**
    
    
    
### Part 8: Data Visualization in Tableau
Understand the importance of data visualization. Know how different data types are encoded in visualizations. Select the most effective chart or graph based on the data being displayed.
- **[Project: Create a Tableau Story](https://github.com/AlabdulhadiSara/Data-Analysis-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project%208)**
